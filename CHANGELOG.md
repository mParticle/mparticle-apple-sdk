# mParticle Apple SDK CHANGELOG

## 8.4.0

This release adds a new API allowing kits to consumed batched data. This allows you to create custom kits that process uploaded mParticle data and e.g. send it to your own server.

## 8.3.3

- Fix app fore thread logic if not awaiting kits

This release resolves an issue where if automatic session tracking was enabled, the SDK could potentially block the main thread when handling app foreground notifications, if those resulted in a new session being started and the SDK was not waiting for kits to set integration attributes.

## 8.3.2

- Fix Filtering for MPBaseEvent. Resolves an issue where MediaEvents where not properly forwarded to kits

## 8.3.1

- Add Crash Logging for PLCrashReporter
- Accept Custom Flags from WebView JS Bridge
- Add previous foreground time to app_fore messages

## 8.3.0

- Ensure the latest ATT status is included with every upload. Uploads are typically immutable once stored. For ATT status and IDFA, the SDK will update pending, stored uploads with the latest ATT status and remove IDFA based on ATT status prior to upload

- Block asserts for SPM in release mode. This prevents crashes in production apps if e.g. an NSNull value is set as an event attribute

## 8.2.0

This release adds support for collecting a device’s App Tracking Transparency authorization status for improved iOS 14 compatibility.

You can call `setATTStatus:withTimestampMillis:` on the MParticle sharedInstance to specify the result of prompting the user. If you pass nil for the timestamp, the SDK will use the current date and time.

- Support for Xcode 12.5 beta
- Update the sample app to set ATT status, as well as login and logout support

## 8.1.4

- Fix unused return values
- Use ARCHS
- Change imports to modular for sqlite

## 8.1.3

- Fix MPConnector for MPURL
- Improve UA for Number Values

This resolves an issue where signature headers could be computed improperly with certain network configuration settings.

## 8.1.2

This release includes a number of bugfixes:

- Fix incrementUserAttribute UAC Message
- Refactor UserAttributes
- Fix potential DB access on main, add finalize
- Add MPURL to support custom endpoints and overriding subdirectories

## 8.1.1

- Fix Other6 Identity Login Issue
This resolves an issue where identity login requests that included certain MPIdentities were always returning a 400 response.

## 8.1.0

### Data Blocking

This release adds support for Data Blocking to Kits!

To enable blocking, ensure you are specifying your data plan ID (and optionally version) in MParticleOptions.

This will enable the SDK to download your data plan and use it to block unplanned data from going to kits based on your blocking settings in the platform.

You can also specify blocking settings locally during SDK init using a new property `MPDataPlanOptions` on your `MParticleOptions` object.

If you specify local settings, these will override configuration sent by the server.

Note: the current implementation of blocking does not include validation logic to handle e.g. `regex`, or `min`/`max` keywords.

#### Session API updates

This release includes changes to improve the timing with which MParticle.sharedInstance.currentSession becomes available after starting the SDK, as well as introducing new APIs for managing sessions.

When starting the SDK, you now have the option `shouldBeginSession` which allows you to easily start a session on SDK init even if you are using manual session tracking otherwise.

This release also introduces the same logic when you log an event. By default, sessions will be created when logging events, but you can set shouldBeginSession to false on the event to prevent this. In most cases, you will want to ensure shouldBeginSession is false if the SDK is launched into the background from e.g. a `content-available` push notification.

#### Other items

Several additional bugfixes are included in this release:

- Add Action Identifier to Notifications
- Add String Support For Product Price
- Update JSON Format of User Attributes
- Remove Deprecated Cart State from Commerce Event Data
- Fix Content Available Notification Bug
- Update MPCustomModulePreference

Note: If you have filters that currently depend on the fact that the SDK was previously encoding boolean values as `Y` and `N`, you will need to update those to look for `true` and `false` before updating to this version of the SDK, otherwise your filters will not take effect.

## 8.0.1

This release updates the SDK for iOS 14.

Important behavioral and API changes:

- The SDK no longer queries for IDFA. You must provide the IDFA to the SDK if desired
- Introduction of the `MPIdentity` enum, allowing for both device and user identities to be supplied to the identity API
- Kits have been updated to use the latest iOS 14 betas of their respective SDKs:

    | Partner SDK | Apple SDK v7 | Apple SDK v8 |
    |-------------|--------------|--------------|
    | Airship     | ~> 12.0      | ~> 14.0.0    |
    | AppsFlyer   | ~> 5.0       | ~> 6.0       |
    | Apptentive  | ~> 5.2       | ~> 5.3       |
    | Apptimize   | ~> 3.0       | ~> 3.2       |
    | Branch      | ~> 0.31.2    | ~> 0.35      |
    | Braze       | ~> 3.20      | ~> 3.27      |
    | Crittercism | '5.6.7'      | ~> 5.0       |
    | Leanplum    | ~> 2.6       | ~> 3.0       |
    | Localytics  | ~> 5.2       | ~> 6.0       |
    | Primer      | '3.2.3'      | ~> 3.6       |

- The above are using wildcard dependencies, see here for how to interpret these: https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/the-podfile.html#specifying-pod-versions
- If you don't see a kit listed here, it was probably already using a wildcard dependency. It has been released as is, as version 8.0.1, and will automatically pull in the latest version of the partner's SDK.

- AppsFlyer - Update to AppsFlyer to version 5.0.0
- Branch - Update Branch to version 0.31.2

## 7.12.7

### Core

This release addresses an issue where the SDK might crash when logging commerce events, if certain recently-updated kits that support commerce are included.

In addition, a change has been included that should improve SDK responsiveness and prevent the SDK
from inadvertently showing up in unrelated stack traces due to unnecessarily waiting to run on
the main queue when processing network responses.

### Kits

- Adobe - Update to prevent multiple defined symbol linker error

## 7.12.6

### Core

This release includes a number of targeted bug fixes to the SDK.

- Set device token on message queue

- Deprecate `logCommerceEvent:` method--please call `logEvent:` instead.

### Kits

- Adobe - Update for Media SDK beta 3

## 7.12.5

### Core

#### User Agent Collection

This release resolves an issue where user agent collection may not work correctly for certain app configurations.

This is due to a behavior change by Apple that appears to be isolated to Swift projects, where the application state within didFinishLaunching is set to background instead of inactive.

Also included is a change to allow user agent collection in iOS extensions.

### Kits

- None

## 7.12.4

### Core

#### User Agent Collection
- This release restores support for automatic collection of browser user agent by the SDK.

- This release also deprecates the Cart API. The Cart API was originally designed to maintain and hold on to product objects to be appended automatically to Commerce events. Over time we have found it to be better practice for the hosting app to maintain shopping cart state rather than the mParticle SDK. In place of the Cart API, please include all of the applicable product objects with each Commerce event.

### Kits

- Updates for iOS 13

## 7.12.3

- This release fixes a typo that caused `MPEvent` attributes to return nil if the deprecated `info` property was used. Due to our kits not yet having been updated to use the new property name, this was resulting in empty event attributes dictionaries being forwarded to kits.

## 7.12.2

- This release fixes Commerce events collected over the WKWebView bridge. Previously, the mapping of Web SDK-defined product-actions to Apple SDK product-actions was incorrect.

## 7.12.1

### Core

- This release rolls back a change to the `MPEventType` enum that caused problems with Swift compatibility and adds Swift unit tests to ensure this API remains stable going forward.

- Guard against potential crash if null product array is received from JS webview integration

### Kits

- None

## 7.12.0

## mParticle Media SDK

This release introduces support for the [mParticle Apple Media SDK](https://github.com/mParticle/mparticle-apple-media-sdk)!

Media tracking capabilities have been added by creating a separate module that you can add to your project in addition to the core SDK.

For more details, see the Media SDK repository: https://github.com/mParticle/mparticle-apple-media-sdk

### Other items

- You may notice that our main `MParticle#logEvent:` API has been changed to take a different type of parameter. This should not affect your code, except you can now pass commerce events to that method in addition to `MPEvent` objects.

- This release also includes a change to improve session management in cases where the background timer was not allowed to run by the OS.

## 7.11.0

## iOS 13 Official Support
### Push Registration
If you are collecting push registration tokens and using them for server-side integrations, this is a *critical update*. If you are only registering for push via kits (such as Braze), you can use iOS Braze kit 7.10.7 or later with iOS 13.

### UIWebView and User Agent Collection
Support for UIWebView has been removed. User agent collection has been disabled in this release. You may manually supply the user agent to the MParticleOptions object on SDK initialization if required.

## 7.10.5

## Core

- Ensure user attributes are filtered on FilteredMParticleUser
- Simplify APIs and options used to start the SDK

## Kits

- Braze - Update API usage for endpoint and location
- Firebase - Standardize custom attribute keys and values
- Adobe - Fix linker error if modules are disabled

## 7.10.4

## Critical Bug Fixes

This release fixes a critical bug in SDK versions 7.8.6 and later where uploads could be prematurely deleted if the network request failed due to the device being offline.

This release also fixes a crash while migrating the SDK's internal database. The crash occurs for apps that had opted into manual-session tracking in a previous version of the SDK, and then upgraded to the latest version of the SDK.

## Core

- Bugfix for upload response processing
- Fix session id migration for messages and uploads

## Kits

- Appboy - Update endpoint override logic

## 7.10.2

## Core

Note: To ensure proper validation, this release updates the userIdentities property of MPIdentityApiRequest to be an immutable dictionary.

If you happened to be modifying this dictionary directly, you will need to update your code to call setUserIdentity:identityType: instead.

- Don't allow direct mutation of request identities
- Guard against nil events

## Kits

- Button - Update kit to use Button Merchant Library

## 7.10.1

## Core

- Update for Xcode 11
- Respect max age expiration for configuration requests

## Kits

- Update Urban Airship import statements

## 7.10.0

This release introduces support for user alias requests.

Aliasing allows you to copy data from one user to another, typically for the purpose of building audiences that include actions a user may have taken before they logged in.

This release also adds properties to a user that indicate when this user was first or last seen by the SDK. Getting the list of all users known to the SDK now sorts by the last time each user was seen.

## Core

- Add support for sending user alias requests
- Move sessionTimeout to MParticleOptions
- Guard against unexpected radio technology values
- Implement Inspector protocol
- Reachability improvements

## Kits

- Apptentive - Add ability to delay Apptentive SDK initialization

- Optimizely - Update Optimizely SDK to 3.0

## 7.9.0

## Core

### Session tracking update

This release updates the mechanism whereby the SDK tracks user sessions.

Previously the SDK would start a session whenever an event was received, even if the event was triggered when processing a background push or location update.

The SDK now measures sessions based on user engagement i.e. when the app is in the foreground and visible to the user.

In the past the SDK would make special accommodations for apps that have long running background sessions due to use of location or background audio, in that sessions would continue even when the app remained in the background for an extended period of time. As of this release, this behavior has changed so that the session ends when the app is backgrounded even if, for example, background audio is still playing.

We have also introduced new APIs to manually begin and end sessions, so that you may customize this behavior if necessary.

Finally, this release also addresses an issue where session end messages may not have been created after the app was forcibly killed.

## Kits

- Optimizely - Update for tvOS

## 7.8.1

## Core

- Updates retry logic for collecting Apple Search Ads and introduces an option to disable collection.

## Kits

## 7.7.5

## Critical Bug Fix

This release contains a bug fix for a regression present in SDK versions 7.7.3 and 7.7.4. The issue only affects customers using client-side "kit" integrations. For these customers, events are sent as duplicates to each integration. If your app is on an impacted SDK, you can use mParticle's server-side filtering features to prevent events from being sent until you can upgrade to SDK 7.7.5 or later.

## Core SDK Updates

### Carthage binary artifacts

In addition to directly attaching binary artifacts to GitHub releases,
we will be providing Carthage json manifest files in the root of each repo
that supports Carthage.

This helps support the use of some command line flags (like --no-use-binaries)
that may not otherwise work properly with certain kits (e.g. Braze/mParticle-Appboy)

Please note that due to the required sequence of steps for the release process,
the json files will be generated and published prior to the artifacts being
uploaded, so the links in the json files may be invalid for a short period of time
after initially being committed.

### Updated SDK limits

The SDK no longer limits the size of non-array event attribute values to 255 characters,
lengths of up to 4096 characters are now supported.

Some obsolete limits have been removed.

### New SDK limits

Add limits for message, batch size

This release results in messages larger than 100K being dropped.

If your log level is set to Error or higher, a message will be logged
when this occurs.

This release also limits the total message bytes and total number
of messages that can be packed into each batch.

However, these batch-level limits will not result in dropped data
since the SDK will enforce the limits by producing smaller batches.

### Disable kits for Anonymous Users

You can now control which kits are enabled and disabled based on a user's "logged in" state. A common use case would be to initialize a given kit for non-anonymous (logged in) users. Navigate to a kit's connection settings in your mParticle dashboard to give this a try.

- Mark user segments API deprecated
- Fix kit location forwarding

## Kit Updates

- Appboy - Bugfix for in app message delegate
- AppsFlyer - Mark as static_framework to support `use_frameworks!`
- Update Taplytics to 2.33.0

## 7.7.1

## Core SDK Updates

- Fix Reachability bug where we were incorrectly reporting users as being on wifi when they were actually using mobile data

## Kit Updates

- Kochava - Add support for mParticle Attribution API

## 7.7.0

## Core SDK Updates

- We've cleaned up and addressed several bugs around automatic push-notification event tracking.
- Several new APIs have also been introduced to control the tracking of push notifications. You can now manually log that a push has been received or opened. You can also disable the automatic collection of those two events via the MParticleOptions "trackNotifications" property.
- We've also addressed an issue whereby NSNull is passed to the legacy, pre-IDSync kit APIs as several kits, such as Branch, were unable to handle NSNull.

## Kit Updates

### Taplytics Kit

The Taplytics kit has been released with much help from the Taplytics team!

## 7.6.0

## 7.5.4

## Core SDK Updates

- Update the order of forwarding identities to kits

## Kit Updates

- Braze (mParticle-Appboy): Implement modify and login MPKitProtocol methods. This ensures that users are assigned the correct email address when sharing the same device.

**Warning**: You must be using version 7.3.0 or later of the core SDK in order to use this version of the Braze kit.

## 7.5.3

## Core SDK Updates

- None

## Kit Updates

- AppsFlyer: Map MPCommerceEvent product SKUs to af_content_id
- Localytics: Add Carthage support

## 7.5.2

- This release updates the `mParticleSessionDidBeginNotification` and `mParticleSessionDidEndNotification` notifications to contain the session GUID rather than the SQLite autoincrement ID. This GUID will match the GUID that is communicated via mParticle's server-to-server integrations.
- This release also updates the UIApplication `openURL` signature exposed by the SDK to be more compatible with Swift.

## 7.5.1

- This release completely removes the SDK's primary UIApplication termination listener. Prior to this change, the SDK could prevent process termination while it was performing several cleanup activities.

## 7.5.0

### iOS 12 beta and iOS 12 support

This release updates the SDK to handle several changes present in the latest beta builds of Xcode 10 and iOS 12.

## 7.4.2

- This releases addresses several synchronization issues with internal SDK properties that could lead to crashes.  

## 7.4.1

- This releases updates the SDK's UIAppication termination handler to perform operations sychronously. This handler is used to capture the latest device state prior to app force-closes such that subsequent uploads are accurate. Doing this sychronously on the main thread is required to avoid undefined behavior due to iOS process destruction.

## 7.4.0

- This release is a follow up to version 7.3.11 and moves all kit APIs invocations to the main thread rather than the mParticle SDK's message queue.

## 7.3.13

- This release updates the timing of when user identities are set on the MParticleUser object. This makes it so that once an identity callback is returned, the provided MParticleUser object has the most up-to-date identities present and queryable.

## 7.3.12

- This release addresses a migration-crash for customers upgrading from version 6 of the SDK and who are using the SDK's crash-detection APIs.
- This release also adds an appledoc plist to source such that the Appledocs can be generated more easily. We also host the Appledocs on the mParticle documentation site: https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/sdk/ios/appledocs/index.html

## 7.3.11

- This release ensures that kits are always started on the main thread rather than the SDK's internal serial queue. Kits will still not be started sychronously when calling `MParticle.start`, but they will be initialized on the main thread on a later run-loop. 

## 7.3.10

- This release updates the SDK's app extension support. The `MPARTICLE_APP_EXTENSIONS` flag is no longer necessary and the SDK will determine if it's running in an app extension based off the `appex` suffix in the app bundle.

## 7.3.9

- This release addresses warnings due to the Xcode main thread checker and adds additional synchronization for internal properties that are accessed acrossed threads.

## 7.3.8

## Core SDK Updates

- This release fixes an issue where uploads could be delayed until app background

## Kit Updates

- Kochava: Fix user identity usage to conform to the latest `FilteredMParticleUser` APIs

## 7.3.7

### Core SDK Updates

#### GDPR Consent Management

The SDK can now dynamically enable and disable kits based on the current user's ConsentState, for GDPR and any other regulation. This lets you enable or disable individual kits only if a given Consent purpose or purposes have been granted or rejected by the user.

##### Additional Updates

- New NetworkOptions API letting you customize SSL pinning and SDK endpoints.
- Ability to query for all users that the SDK has tracked locally on the device.
- Bugfix to address simulator reachability issues

### Kit Updates

- Leanplum: Fix user identity query to conform to the latest `FilteredMParticleUser` APIs

## 7.3.6

- This release updates the SDK's SQLite connection to allow for full multi-threaded access. The SDK does not generally access SQLite outside of a single serial queue, but in certain situations it will and could have potentially caused a crash due to simultanous access.

## 7.3.5

- This release fixes potential SQLite crashes caused by multi-threaded SQLite access caused by the SDK's significant time-change listener.
- This release addresses a potential crash or error log caused by kits that implement the attribution API and return a nil attribution result.

## 7.3.4 

- This is a **critical** bug fix release. Prior to this, the SDK would upload duplicate kit forwarding statistics. These statistic do not impact forwarding - but they populate the mParticle Event Forwarding dashboard. This change is crucial for proper reporting as well as reducing the amount of SDK SQL storage and upload payload size.

## 7.3.3

- This release makes a change to the KitProtocol to remove the `onUserIdentified` API.

## 7.3.2

This release replaces the previous release 7.3.1, addressing a crash that can occur on startup when certain configuration settings are present.

The following changes from 7.3.1 are also included:

Addresses an issue where configuration could be purged by the OS on low disk space devices and cleans up some compiler warnings.

Updates the Branch kit with support for Branch's v2 event tracking APIs, collecting search ads attribution and various other improvements.

## 7.3.1

- This release moves kit configuration cache into NSUserDefaults to ensure it is not deleted on devices with low storage space.

## 7.3.0

- This release introduces a series of enhancements to the SDK to ensure that all database and filesystem operations are performed off of the main thread. The SDK's internal message queue is now relied on for all operations.

## 7.2.1

This release optimizes SDK startup time by deferring or avoiding expensive operations that otherwise were taking place during SDK start.

In addition, it introduces an option to start kits asynchronously.

Here are a few important notes about this release:

- If you are using the Adjust kit, you must update to version 7.2.1 of the kit in coordination with this update to the core SDK. Otherwise your Adjust environment will not be set properly.
- The SDK no longer automatically disables logging in production. The default log level is now set to "none". If you increase the log level for your development builds, please ensure that change does not get compiled into the release version of your app.
- App delegate proxying was incorrectly disabled by default. This has been fixed.
- The SDK now collects user agent by default

## 7.2.0

This is a *high priority* update for all users of SDK v7. This update:
- Ensures database migrations from v6 to v7 occur on a background thread.
- Reduces the amount of data that is migrated.
- Simplifies batch upload creation and session deletion logic to ensure the SDK's database is fully cleared when appropriate.

## 7.1.5

### Core SDK Updates

- Avoid blocking the main thread while migrating the database
- Clean up analyzer warnings

### Kit Updates

- None

## 7.1.4

### Core SDK Updates

- None

### Kit Updates

- Leanplum

#### Leanplum Email Campaigns

The Leanplum kit has been updated to set "email" as a user attribute on the Leanplum SDK to enable Leanplum email campaigns. If you would not like to send email to Leanplum, you may filter email to Leanplum via the mParticle Filters UI.

## 7.1.3

### Core SDK Updates

**This SDK release is a required update for all customers who are migrating from v6.**

It fixes an issue where migrated user identities were not being included when building the initial identity request.

### Kit Updates

- None

## 7.1.2

### Core SDK Updates

- Cache user agent until OS version changes
- Fix Nil User Identity Issue

This release optimizes the capture of user agent to only happen when the OS version changes.

### Kit Updates

- None

## 7.1.1

### Core SDK Updates

- Avoid requesting config before start

This release fixes a bug where the SDK could trigger a call to config before start was called.

### Kit Updates

- None

## 7.1.0

# IDSync

Version 7.1.0 is the first non-beta release of the new mParticle IDSync framework. It contains many new features as well as breaking changes:

- New Identity APIs allowing custom IDSync "strategies" per customer. 
- Included in the new APIs is a `MParticleUser` object, as well as the new APIs for `login`, `logout`, `modify`, and more! [You can read more about the new Identity APIs here](https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/sdk/ios/identity).
- `MParticleOptions` object for explicit SDK configuration.
- New "Attribution" API, which replaces the former "deferred deeplink" API.

## Migrating from SDK v6

Prior to upgrading to version 7, your mParticle org **must** be provisioned with an Identity Strategy. Please contact the mParticle Customer Success team at support@mparticle.com. 

The new SDK contains multiple breaking API changes. To learn how to migrate your existing code, please [reference the iOS migration guide](https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/sdk/ios/getting-started#upgrade-to-version-7-of-the-sdk).

## 7.0.9

### Core SDK Updates

This release updates MPIdentityApiRequest by removing the copyUserAttributes setting, and adding an optional onUserAlias block. By setting this block on your request, you can copy user attributes per your business logic from one user to the next. You can also copy object from the user's cart.
