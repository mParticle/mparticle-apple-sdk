# mParticle Apple SDK CHANGELOG

## 7.2.0

This is a *high priority* update for all users of SDK v7. This update:
- Ensures database migrations from v6 to v7 occur on a background thread.
- Reduces the amount of data that is migrated.
- Simplifies batch upload creation and session deletion logic to ensure the SDK's database is fully cleared when appropriate.

## 7.1.5

### Core SDK Updates

- Avoid blocking the main thread while migrating the database
- Clean up analyzer warnings

### Kit Updates

- None

## 7.1.4

### Core SDK Updates

- None

### Kit Updates

- Leanplum

#### Leanplum Email Campaigns

The Leanplum kit has been updated to set "email" as a user attribute on the Leanplum SDK to enable Leanplum email campaigns. If you would not like to send email to Leanplum, you may filter email to Leanplum via the mParticle Filters UI.

## 7.1.3

### Core SDK Updates

**This SDK release is a required update for all customers who are migrating from v6.**

It fixes an issue where migrated user identities were not being included when building the initial identity request.

### Kit Updates

- None

## 7.1.2

### Core SDK Updates

- Cache user agent until OS version changes
- Fix Nil User Identity Issue

This release optimizes the capture of user agent to only happen when the OS version changes.

## 7.1.0

# IDSync

Version 7.1.0 is the first non-beta release of the new mParticle IDSync framework. It contains many new features as well as breaking changes:

- New Identity APIs allowing custom IDSync "strategies" per customer. 
- Included in the new APIs is a `MParticleUser` object, as well as the new APIs for `login`, `logout`, `modify`, and more! [You can read more about the new Identity APIs here](https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/sdk/ios/identity).
- `MParticleOptions` object for explicit SDK configuration.
- New "Attribution" API, which replaces the former "deferred deeplink" API.

## Migrating from SDK v6

Prior to upgrading to version 7, your mParticle org **must** be provisioned with an Identity Strategy. Please contact the mParticle Customer Success team at support@mparticle.com. 

The new SDK contains multiple breaking API changes. To learn how to migrate your existing code, please [reference the iOS migration guide](https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/sdk/ios/getting-started#upgrade-to-version-7-of-the-sdk).

## 7.0.9

### Core SDK Updates

This release updates MPIdentityApiRequest by removing the copyUserAttributes setting, and adding an optional onUserAlias block. By setting this block on your request, you can copy user attributes per your business logic from one user to the next. You can also copy object from the user's cart.
