@class MPProduct;

/**
 This class is used to describe a product bag to hold the state of products in the hands of a user. Please note a difference 
 when compared with a shopping cart. A product bag is intended to represent product samples shipped for trial by a user, which 
 later may return the samples or add one or more to a shopping cart with the intent of purchasing them.

 Bags, and products added to them are persisted throughout the lifetime of the application. It is up to you to remove products from 
 a bag, and remove bags according to their respective life-cycles in your app.
 
 You should not try to create independent instance of this class, instead you should use the instance provided to you via the 
 mParticle singleton.
 
 <b>Usage:</b>
 
 <b>Swift</b>
 <pre><code>
 MParticle.sharedInstance().bags.addProduct(product1, toBag:"bag name")
 </code></pre>
 
 <b>Objective-C</b>
 <pre><code>
 [[MParticle sharedInstance].bags addProduct:product1 toBag:&#64;"bag name"];
 </code></pre>
